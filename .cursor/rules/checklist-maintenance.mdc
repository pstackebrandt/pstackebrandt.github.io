Checklist Maintenance Rules
===========================

Status Indicators
-----------------

- ‚úÖ Completed: Task is fully implemented and verified
- - [ ] Todo: Task not yet started or completed
- üîÑ In-progress: Work has started but not completed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked: Waiting on external dependency

Organization
------------

- Group by functional area (Docker, Security, etc.)
- List completed items first within each section
- Place priority items immediately after completed items
- Use logical workflow order for sections

Formatting
----------

- Use h1 (`#`) for document title (Setext-style with `=====`)
- Use h2 (`##`) for main sections (Setext-style with `-----`)
- Use h3 (`###`) for subsections (`###` atx-style)
- Use bullet lists for checklist items
- Use 2-space indentation for nested items
- Keep line length under 120 characters
- Use code blocks with language identifiers

Example
-------

```markdown
## Security

‚úÖ HTTPS redirection configured  
‚úÖ Sensitive files excluded from source control  

- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints  
- [ ] Implement CORS policy configuration  
```

Update Process
--------------

1. Review project status to identify completed items
2. Update status indicators accordingly
3. Add new requirements that have emerged
4. Remove duplicate or obsolete items
5. Ensure cross-references remain valid

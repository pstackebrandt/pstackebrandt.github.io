Standards-First Rule
====================

The Rule
--------

**Always default to established industry standards and conventions unless they introduce
unnecessary overhead or complexity for the specific context. Prefer simplicity and
familiarity over novel approaches unless there's a compelling reason to deviate.**

Application Examples
--------------------

- Use `.cursor/rules` instead of `cursor-rules/` for Cursor IDE configuration
- Follow standard naming conventions for files and folders (e.g., `.vscode`, `.git`)
- Adopt established coding conventions for the primary language/framework
- Use standard project structures unless project-specific needs dictate otherwise
- Implement common design patterns rather than inventing alternatives

When to Deviate
---------------

Deviation from standards is appropriate when:

1. The standard introduces significant unnecessary complexity
2. Project requirements strongly conflict with the standard approach
3. Performance or resource constraints necessitate a different solution
4. The standard is obsolete or being replaced by a newer standard
5. The team has established a well-documented alternative that provides clear benefits

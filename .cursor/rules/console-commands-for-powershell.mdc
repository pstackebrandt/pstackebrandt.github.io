Generate PowerShell 7 commands for Windows 11, not Bash syntax:

- PowerShell cmdlets: Get-ChildItem (not ls), Set-Location (not cd)
- Paths use backslashes (C:\Users\)
- Flags use single hyphen (-Force)
- Variables: $variable, string interpolation: "$()"
- Environment variables: $env:VARIABLE
- Piping: | (with proper object handling)
- Command separation: ; (not &&)
- Redirection: >, >>, 2>

Prefer PowerShell-native approaches over cmd.exe commands.
